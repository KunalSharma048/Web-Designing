Work Philosophy: A brief description of your beliefs about yourself and the industry.
Career Goals: Your professional goals for the next five years.

Skill Areas: Identify three to five of the major skill set areas you have that would be important for someone in your career field to have. Examples include: Management, Computer Skills, Public Relations, Leadership, Accounting, Communications, and Customer Service.
