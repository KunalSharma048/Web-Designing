	Designing a website takes a lot of work and planning. Many aspects have to come together to create a <b style="color:blue;">well-designed site.</b>

Designers often prepare a mockup of the website before the content is ready. To test the look of the layout they use fake text called lorem ipsum.

Lorem ipsum is a garbled form of Latin. It is also called dummy text because it looks like content but is unreadable.

Lorem ipsum is a piece of text that holds the place of real content. Using placeholder text allows designers to focus on the visual design of a website.
