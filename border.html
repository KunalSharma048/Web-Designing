	 have to come together to create a well-designed site. Designers often prepare a mockup of the website before the content is ready. To test the look of the layout they use fake text called lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum is a garbled form of Latin. It is also called dummy text because it looks like content but is unreadable. Lorem ipsum is a piece of text that holds the place of real content. Using placeholder text allows designers to focus on the visual design of a website.
